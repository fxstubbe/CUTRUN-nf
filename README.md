## Introduction

**CUT&RUN-nf** is a best-practice bioinformatic analysis pipeline for CUT&RUN data.

This pipeline uses Nextflow, a portable and reproducible workflow tool that simplifies deployment with containerization and package management. Each process runs in its own container, ensuring easy maintenance and dependency updates, and leverages nf-core/modules where possible.


1. Read QC (FastQC)
2. Adapter and quality trimming (Trim Galore!)
3. Alignment to both target and spike-in genomes (Bowtie 2)
4. Filter on quality, sort and index alignments (samtools)
5. (Optional) Duplicate read marking (picard)
6. Create bedGraph|BigWig files (bedtools
7. Peak calling (SEACR, MACS2) -- IN PROGRESS
8. Consensus peak merging and reporting (bedtools) -- IN PROGRESS
9. Fragment-based quality control (deepTools)
10. Peak-based quality control (bedtools, custom python) -- IN PROGRESS



## Usage

> [!NOTE]
> If you are new to Nextflow and nf-core, please refer to [this page](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/installation) on how to set-up Nextflow. Make sure to [test your setup](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/introduction#how-to-run-a-pipeline) with `-profile test` before running the workflow on actual data.

First, prepare a samplesheet where each row represents a sequenced library. It should look as follow:

`samplesheet.csv`:

```csv
id,group,replicate,fastq_path_1,fastq_path_2,control
N2_K27_1,K27,1,Path to read Fwd,Path the read Rev,N2_neg
```

Now, you can run the pipeline using:


```bash
nextflow run cutrun-nf.nf \
   -profile <laptop/baobab/.../custon> \
   --input samplesheet.csv \
   --outdir <OUTDIR>
```

> [!WARNING]
> Please provide pipeline parameters via the CLI or Nextflow `-params-file` option. Custom config files including those provided by the `-c` Nextflow option can be used to provide any configuration _**except for parameters**_; see [docs](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/getting_started/configuration#custom-configuration-files).
